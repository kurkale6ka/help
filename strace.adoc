Each line contains the system call name, followed by its arguments in
parentheses and its return value (-1 for error)

call(args) = return value

system calls are the kernel interface for userland processes

== open
open(2) returns a file descriptor for use in subsequent system calls

 open("/a/file", O_RDONLY) = 8 # reused by 'read' below
 read(8, "blabla"..., 65536) = 65536
