read about ap management network

Create a VLAN:
assign the same PVID, Port VLAN ID, to a bunch of ports

A trunk port can carry traffic for all VLANs. For this to work frames must be tagged with their VLAN id. Normal ports are called access ports

fw - vlan port: tag frame with pvid
ap - trunk port: tag frame with pvid (as defined in the wlans setup on the ap)

can trunk ports be part of a vlan?

T, U, F meaning on Dell 2834 switch

U - untagged, ie: non trunk port
T - tagged, ie: trunk port
F - forbidden...

Define VLAN10:

        1 2 3 4 . . . 22 23 24
Static  U U U U       T  T  T
Current U U U U       T  T  T
   \
    static or saved value vs current temporarily changed value but not persisted?

NB: we have to define both the untagged and the tagged ports

LAG???
