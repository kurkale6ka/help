OSI

2. link layer: frame  host   A - MAC addresses - frame  host   B
3. inet layer: packet router A - IP  addresses - packet router B
4. transport layer: TCP
5. app layer: SSH, HTTP, ...

|o|o| - console (serial) port

uplink port, switch, router

A route has host scope when it leads to the local host.
A route has link scope when it leads to the local network.
A route has universe scope when it leads to addresses more than one hop away.

managed switches support VLANs

Routing

The kernel takes care of routing automagically, this can be checked with route
-n... auto flag. The only time we need explicit routing is when it isn't
obvious.

Two ports being on the same NIC, doesn't mean that the 2 associated nets will
auto communicate. If the ports are on the same net yes, if on different nets,
IP forwarding is enabled and there is an allowing firewall rule then yes, else
not.

Notes:
* the admin decides what nets they will be on when configuring
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-...

* Once IP forwarding is enabled, all nets can communicate thus you need proper
  firewall rules to prevent this

Gateways

route -n
In the Destination column, 0.0.0.0 (default) matches all IPv4 addresses
In the Gateway     column, 0.0.0.0 (*)       indicates that there is no gateway
                                             and the packet should not be routed (sent locally?)

Link Aggregation aka LAG,
aka bond/team (NIC), bundle, trunk, EtherChannel, Port Channel...

Multiple physical links are combined into one logical link. Benefits:
* Increased throughput: traffic load balanced between links
* Redundancy: can survive the loss of links/devices

                                               +-- --+
ex: switches linked by more than 1 cable => sw +-- --+ sw
                                               +-- --+

Multi homed means that our firewalls are connected to several ISPs for high availability
