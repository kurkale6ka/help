Indexing when using an encrypted home directory

Because ~ is BIND mounted and of type ecryptfs so normal updatedb won't work unless:
PRUNEFS-=ecryptfs and PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS='no'

/etc/zsh/zprofile
export LOCATE_PATH=/home/user/var/mlocate.db

/etc/updatedb.conf
PRUNEPATHS = "... /home/.ecryptfs"

Index your home files:
updatedb -l 0 -o ~/var/mlocate.db -U ~
TODO: run on a daily basis

Tips

locate / # all indexed files since absolute paths are recorded
