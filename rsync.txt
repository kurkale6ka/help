Filters
-f '+ foo' include files and directories named foo
-f '- foo/' exclude directories named foo
-f '+ */' -f '+ *.vim' -f '- *' transfer vim files only
        \
         the / means directory objects

-f".- $HOME/.gitignore" -f':- .gitignore' -f'- .git'
             \                   \
              \                   ignore patterns in .gitignore files located anywhere
               exclude patterns in this file
               the - is needed because the patterns don't start with -/+/...
               otherwise ". $HOME/.gitignore" would be enough

after the following 2, the directory is included (first EXACT match wins???):
+ colors/
- colors/

after the following 2, the directory is excluded:
+ colors/
- *

ex: rsync -ai -f '+ */' -f '- *' ~/foo /tmp # copy foo's directory structure to /tmp

Archive mode -a:
-r: recursive
-l: copy symlinks as symlinks
-p: preserve permissions
-t: preserve modification times
-g: preserve group
-o: preserve owner (super-user only)
-D: --devices:  preserve device files (super-user only)
    --specials: preserve special files

Notes about -d and -a:
* without -a or -d, no dirs would be transfered
* -d allows to copy dirs but isn't recursive

rsync -a ~/foo  /tmp # copy ~/foo and its contents to /tmp
rsync -d ~/foo  /tmp # copy ~/foo without its contents to /tmp
rsync -d ~/foo/ /tmp # copy ~/foo's contents to /tmp

Common:
-n: dry run

--delete: if the file exists in the destination only, delete it
-u: if the destination file has a more recent modification time, don't update it

-z: enable compression
    use to improve bandwidth => not for local operation unless good CPU

Less common:
-e: "ssh -l user_if_different_than_local"
-I: compare files even if size and timestamp are the same
    (this happens if -t is omitted => not very efficient)
--size-only: compare files based on size only (no modification timestamp)

--ignore-existing: transfer new files only (non existing on destination)
--existing: transfer old files only (already existing on destination)

-W: transfer whole modified files (not only the changed blocks) if network
    bandwidth is not an issue for you but CPU is! (default for local)

Examples:
rsync -ain src  dst # copies src            to dst
rsync -ain src/ dst # copies src's contents to dst

rsync -ai --no-t --remove-source-files --ignore-existing 2012/ pics/2012
         \    \             \                   \
          \    \             \                   only transfer new files
           \    \             del from source after transfer
            \    don't compare timestamps
             change summaries

rsync -ain --modify-window=432000 2015/ ../pics/2015
                     \
                      timestamps are considered different only above 5 days (432000 seconds)
