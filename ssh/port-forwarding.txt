                              TCP Port forwarding

Local
-----
ssh -fNL [localhost:]port:remotehost:port gateway
     |+- do not execute a remote command
     +- go to background (exiting the terminal won't close the tunnel)

example:
our LAN policy prevents access to imgur.com but our jumphost(gateway) can connect:

# locally
ssh -fNL 3000:imgur.com:3000 gateway # localhost:3000 -> gateway -> imgur.com:3000
ssh -fNL 3000:localhost:3000 gateway # localhost:3000 -> gateway:3000
                   \___________/

ask for port 3000 locally, get port 3000 on the remote

in ~/.ssh/config:
host gateway
   LocalForward 3000 imgur.com:3000 # use it with: ssh -fN gateway

use non privileged ports locally:
ssh -fNL 1443:10.1.0.200:443 gateway

Connect via https://localhost:1443

Secure remote (reverse tunnel) desktop assistance
-------------------------------------------------

     gateway  localhost
        |         |
ssh -fNR 5901:localhost:5900 gateway # user, no firewall openings needed
ssh -fNL 5902:localhost:5901 gateway # support (5902 was used vs 5900 to avoid interference with a local VNC server)
        |         |
    localhost  gateway

# then support can connect via:
            Screen Sharing - localhost:5902 # Darwin
vncviewer -SecurityTypes ??? localhost:5902 # Linux

# ^ ask for port 5902 locally, get port 5900 on the user machine.
# a VNC server must listen on port 5900 on the user machine,
# 'Screen Sharing' listens on that port by default.

Dynamic
-------
Forward all ports: "a poor man's VPN"

ssh -fND 4567 gateway # <- the ssh process BECOMES the socks server.

ff request -> (proxy via the local socks server) -> (tunnel to) gateway
                \
                 point to it with - localhost:4567
                 blank all other proxy fields!

It's as if our requests were originating from the gateway.
Connect via https://gateway (or any IP accessible from the gateway)
        NOT https://localhost:4567

why not use ssh -L?
If you need to access https://company.com, https://company.com:1234 and other
ports, you would need to setup as many local tunnels vs a single dynamic one.
