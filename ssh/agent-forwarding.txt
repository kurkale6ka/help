                              SSH Agent Forwarding
           http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html

Password authentication
-----------------------
password required for every connection

--> user
<-- PASSWORD
--> password (/etc/passwd)

Public Key access
-----------------
passphrase required for every connection

--> user + request to use a public key
<-- KEY CHALLENGE (after looking in ~user/.ssh/authorized_keys)
--> key response (after unlocking id_rsa with the passphrase)

Public Key access with Agent support (local key holder)
-------------------------------------------------------
passphrase required only once and used for all connections

--> user + request to use a public key
<-- KEY CHALLENGE
    * The ssh client receives the key challenge, and forwards it to the waiting agent
    * The agent constructs the key response and hands it back to the ssh process
      (after unlocking id_rsa with the passphrase)
--> key response

Public Key access with Agent Forwarding (localhost -> server1 -> server2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
passphrase required only once and used for all connections, plus allow sshing
from remote destinations by forwarding the key challenge to the initial local server

server1 $ --> user + request to use a public key on server2
server1 $ <-- KEY CHALLENGE
              ssh FORWARDS the key challenge to sshd which relays it to localhost,
              which in turn sends a key response, then sshd FORWARDS the key response to ssh
server1 $ --> key response

Forwarding requirements:
localhost
  * ssh key held by the local agent
  * ~/.ssh/config
    Host server1
       ForwardAgent yes # or ssh -A server1

server1
  * AllowAgentForwarding in sshd_config

server1,2
  * public key installed for user
