sed -n '1!G;$!h;$p' myfile

PS = pattern space
HS = hold space

1. read aa: N/A                     , copy to HS        , N/A
2. read bb: append HS to the 2nd PS , copy 2nd PS to HS , N/A
...
5. read ee: append HS to the 5th PS , N/A               , print the last PS

sed reads every line from myfile and puts it in the pattern space.
it then acts on it, possibly adding more lines...
addresses + commands apply on the pattern space, not on myfile.

2p means print the 2nd pattern space
it does NOT mean:
- print the 2nd line from the file (bb in myfile)
- print the 2nd line in the current pattern space (aa below)

myfile        pattern space
  aa -------------- aa
  bb ----------- bb \  this is the 2nd pattern space (bb \n aa)
  cc -------- cc aa /
  dd ----- dd bb
  ee -- ee cc aa
        dd bb
        cc aa
        bb
        aa
