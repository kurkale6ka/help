SELinux: Mandatory Access Control

With MAC, the permissions are not governed by the owner of the resource,
instead, they are imposed by the administrator.

If regular permissions (DAC) disallow an activity, SELinux is not even consulted

In SELinux, everything has a context (label):

..._u:..._r:..._t:sensitivity
    |     |     |
    |     |     +-- type (domain)
    |     +-- role
    +-- user

All fields are used to decide access.
Most of the rules however are made for the type only.

Policy rules:
allow auditd_t auditd_log_t:file { write };

sesearch --allow --source auditd_t --target auditd_log_t --class file --perm write

Possible logging locations:
/var/log/avc.log
/var/log/audit... # lines with avc

search logs:
ausearch -m avc -ts today # access vector cache since today

AVC denial:
msg=audit(1363289005.532:184) # when: date -d@1363289005.532
denied { read } for pid=29199 comm="Vim" # denied for command Vim with PID ...
name="passwd" ino=30 # trying to read file 'passwd' (inode 30)
scontext = staff_u:staff_r:..._t # Vim
tcontext = system_u:object_r:sysfs_t tclass=file # passwd

Ex:
httpd_t not allowed to write to a etc_t location
Solutions:
restorecon or change context or relabel whole system ...
