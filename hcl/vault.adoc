= Secrets

A *kv* secret is a *dict* of key/value pairs

 [/namespace/]engine(e.g kv)/secret
   field1: val1
   field2: val2

== list

 vault secrets list
 vault      kv list GitLab

== put vs patch

`vault kv patch` creates a new version same as `vault kv put`,
the difference is it merges the new _K=V_ pairs with the existing ones
