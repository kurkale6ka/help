dd can be run from Linux itself as it allows for self destruction (unlike
OpenBSD). Once in memory, if not interrupted it will write the whole HD. Of
course when finished, there will be no OS files and most likely it’ll kernel
panic.

What shred does extra is random data but you can also create some ‘randoms’
with openssl or take from urandom (but it’s slower) or from random which is
even slower.
