Static lease:

/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

subnet 192.168.77.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}

host pearl {
   hardware ethernet c4:ee:69:bc:60:a6;
   fixed-address 192.168.77.232;
   option routers 192.168.77.1;
   max-lease-time 120;
   default-lease-time 120;
}

Notes:
subnet is just needed so dhcpd knows what interface to listen on
the lease duration has been decreased to 2min from the default 12h
