PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
===============================

Note: public key certificate == digital certificate

CA - certificate authority:
---------------------------
Issues digital certificates certifying the ownership of a public key
It uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity

Ex: AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADA + mitko is RELIABLE

Note: a CA is identified by its own self-signed certificate
Note: The CA certificates of many well known and trusted CA companies already
      come installed on your PC as part of your Web browser installation.

Scenario: User sends CSR (certificate signing request) to CA, then CA creates
          the digital certificate

Digital signature:
------------------
In public-key systems integrity is guaranteed by using digital signatures. A
digital signature is a message digest which is attached to a message and which
can be used to find out if the message was tampered with during the
conversation. Even the slightest change in the message produces a different
digest. The message digest is encrypted using the sender's private key. The
receiver uses the same message digest algorithm used by the sender to generate
a message digest of the received message.

Asymmetric key algorithms: the key used to encrypt a message is not the same as
                           the key used to decrypt it
