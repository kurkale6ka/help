                      Round Robin Database tool (RRDtool)

RRDtool lets you create a database, store data in it, retrieve that data and
create graphs in PNG format for display on a web browser.

An RRD is composed of RRAs (db -> tables)

rrdtool create test.rrd              \ #                          ,any data out of range is saved as UNKNOWN
            --start 920804400        \ #                         /
            DS:speed:COUNTER:600:U:U \ # DS:var:DST:heartbeat:min:max
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:24     \ #               \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:6:10       #                `time in seconds before saving UNKNOWN
                               \
                                keep 10 samples (an average of 6 values in here)

rrdtool update test.rrd 920804700:12345 920805000:12357 920805300:12363
rrdtool fetch test.rrd AVERAGE --start 920804400 --end 920809200
rrdtool graph speed.png                     \
         --start 920804400 --end 920808000  \
         DEF:myspeed=test.rrd:speed:AVERAGE \
         LINE2:myspeed#FF0000
             \
              pixels

The database holds one data source (DS) named "speed" that represents a counter
that is read every 5m (--step 300) which is the default.

Several round robin archives (RRA) can be kept in the same database.

Data source types (DST):
COUNTER  - saves the rate of change
DERIVE   - same as COUNTER, but it allows negative values as well
ABSOLUTE - also saves the rate of change, but it assumes that the previous value is set to 0
GAUGE    - does not save the rate of change. It saves the actual value itself

RRA:CF:xff:step:rows
--------------------

Consolidation function (CF) - AVERAGE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, and LAST
   Uses step number of PDPs per row (primary data points: one PDP per --step: see create below)

xff - XFiles Factor (XFF), this is the percentage of PDPs that can be unknown
      without making the recorded value unknown

rrdtool create target.rrd         \
        --start 1023654125        \
        --step 300                \ # 5 minutes
        DS:mem:GAUGE:600:0:671744 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:24     \ # (resolution: 12  * 300 = 3600 , one value per 1h,  24 => a day)
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:31      # (resolution: 288 * 300 = 86400, one value per 24H, 31 => a month)
