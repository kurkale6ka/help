A rule of thumb for most people is to get 20 to 30 grams of protein at a meal.
This can be particularly difficult during breakfast. To get started, here are
seven examples of higher protein breakfasts:

1. Day One Toast with nut butter: Two slices of whole-wheat bread with 1
   tablespoon of peanut butter on each, topped with sliced banana. One cup of
   skim milk to drink. Total: 22 grams of protein.

2. Day Two Strawberry smoothie: Blend together 1/2 cup of strawberries, 6
   ounces of plain Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup of uncooked oatmeal, a drizzle of
   honey (as needed) and 1/2 cup of skim milk or soy milk. Total: 21 grams of
   protein.

3. Day Three Mediterranean sandwich: Whole-wheat pita with 4 tablespoons of
   hummus, tomato slices, 1 ounce of goat cheese and 1/4 cup of sliced almonds.
   Have a café latte to drink, made with 1/2 cup of steamed skim milk. Total:
   22 grams of protein.

4. Day Four Melon bowl: Half of a cantaloupe (using the center as a bowl),
   filled with 1 cup of cottage cheese. Total: 25 grams of protein.

5. Day Five Breakfast burrito: Corn tortilla filled with two scrambled eggs,
   sautéed onions, 1/4 cup of black beans and pico de gallo. Total: 25 grams of
   protein.

6. Day Six Apple walnut oatmeal: Cook 3/4 cups of dry oatmeal with 1 and 1/4
   cup of skim milk, and add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, plus 1 chopped apple.
   Sprinkle with cinnamon and drizzle with honey. Total: 24 grams of protein.

7. Day Seven Salad for breakfast: Toss together 1/2 cup of shelled soybeans,
   1/2 cup of chopped tomato and 1 ounce of mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with
   balsamic vinegar, and serve a whole-wheat breadstick on the side. Total: 25
   grams of protein.
