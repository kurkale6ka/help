Layer 5: Application
Layer 4: Transport
Layer 3: Network/Internet # ping, traceroute, firewalls
Layer 2: Data Link        # ip n; LAN only: ARP, IP <-> MAC; can't reach GW?
Layer 1: Physical

1.
ethtool eth0
ifstat
ip -s -c l
ip -br -c l         # DOWN could mean no cable or disabled interface
ip link set eth0 up #   UP would mean it was simply disabled

3.
ip -br -c -4 a
ping: can be rate limited by intermediate network gear => inaccurate application latency

traceroute:
 - TTL 1, 1st router sends back an ICMP Time-to-Live Exceeded packet
 - TTL++, 2nd router ...

DNS (not level 3), if it fails, check if we can connect via IP.
