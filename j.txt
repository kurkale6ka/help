Compositions

at
  [: f g                   capped fork, useful in building long trains
  (f @: g) y  =  f (g y)   monad and monad
x (f @: g) y  =  f (x g y) monad and dyad

appose
  (f &: g) y  =  f (g y)       monad and monad
x (f &: g) y  =  (g x) f (g y)  dyad and monad

@ (atop) and & (compose) are used for tracking:
applications of f track the applications of g

under
  (f &. g) y  =  (g ^: _1) f g y

Trains

  (f g) y  =  y f (g y) monadic hook
x (f g) y  =  x f (g y)  dyadic hook

  (f g h) y  =    (f y) g (h y)   monadic fork
x (f g h) y  =  (x f y) g (x h y)  dyadic fork

4-train   (e f g h) is a hook between         verb e and fork (f g h)
5-train (d e f g h) is a fork between verb d, verb e and fork (f g h)

_9: to 9: - constant functions are useful because they can occur in trains
