sensu client on remote host:
  checks:
    is nginx running?

sensu server processes events:
  exe handlers

sensu services only communicate with the message bus: RabbitMQ

2 check execution schedulers:
  - sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to subscribed clients
  - sensu client (monitoring agent) schedules and executes a “standalone” check
