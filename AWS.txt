Amazon EC2 on-demand Capacity Reservations enable you to create and manage
reserved capacity on Amazon EC2 without any long-term commitment or fixed
terms. This can be very beneficial if you regularly face
InsufficientInstanceCapacity errors when AWS doesn't have enough available
on-demand capacity while starting or launching an EC2 instance.

use Reserved Instances instead if you want to commit to 1 or 3 years
