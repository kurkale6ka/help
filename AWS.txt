Capacity Reservations

Amazon EC2 on-demand Capacity Reservations enable you to create and manage
reserved capacity on Amazon EC2 without any long-term commitment or fixed
terms. This can be very beneficial if you regularly face
InsufficientInstanceCapacity errors when AWS doesn't have enough available
on-demand capacity while starting or launching an EC2 instance.

For cluster placement groups, capacity also means running on the 'same'
hardware and that hardware needs to be reserved.
Use Reserved Instances instead if you want to commit to 1 or 3 years

Placement groups

  cluster -  low latency,  low availability: share hardware => same EC2 type
partition -  avg latency,  avg availability: spread partitions across hardware, 7 partitions per AZ
   spread - high latency, high availability: multi AZ, 7 instances in different racks in 1 group per AZ, diff hw allows for different EC2 types

Elastic Load Balancer

ALB: distribute load based on protocol,  port and HTTP headers, ...
NLB: distribute load based on protocol & port only
     define static IPs (per AZ) for the NLB (so customers can whitelist us)

* dispatch requests to target groups based on routes, query string, headers, IPs (ALB)
                                           /url1 -> tg1
                          /url2, one.example.com -> tg2
  two.example.com, ?platform=mobile, HTTP header -> tg3

  then spread load across multiple or single (e.g containers) host(s) in the
  target group based on health checks (port + route) => seamless handling of
  downstream instances failures

* SSL termination
