File exe bit: X
---------------

chmod -R o=X /folder

* d........x set x on all dirs
* f..x..x--x set x on exe files
      \  \
       `--`--> at least 1 x bit already on
  f......--- else: same as o=

Ex: make sure no file has x for others but all dirs do
chmod -R o-x,o=X /folder

Make others same as group
-------------------------

chmod o=g /folder
