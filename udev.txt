udev
====

Uses:
-----

* Rename a device node from the default name to something else

* Provide an alternative/persistent name for a device node by creating a
  symbolic link to the default device node

* Name a device node based on the output of a program

* Change permissions and ownership of a device node

* Launch a script when a device node is created or deleted (typically when a
  device is attached or unplugged)

* Rename network interfaces

Example:
--------

/etc/udev/rules.d/83-disk.rules
KERNEL=="hdb", DRIVER=="ide-disk", SYMLINK+="sparedisk"

The above rule says: match a device which was named by the kernel as hdb AND
where the driver is ide-disk. Name the device node with the default name and
create a symbolic link to it named sparedisk

Using attributes for finer control:
-----------------------------------

SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTR{size}=="234441648", SYMLINK+="my_disk"
