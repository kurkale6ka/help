                            Software Defined Storage

SDS creates a storage pool from cheap hardware.

- Unlike LVM it spans physical hosts.

- Unlike monolithic SAN and NAS systems that tightly couple software and
  hardware, SDS products enable users to upgrade the software separately from
  the hardware.
