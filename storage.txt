Storage options

file
* hierarchy of folders, limited vertical scalability
* direct + NAS storage

block
* no metadata
* decouple the data from the user’s environment
* doesn’t rely on a single path to data—like file storage does—it can be retrieved quickly
* most expensive
* used in SANs (note: it's also network attached storage)

object
* HTTP API
* most metadata
* objects can’t be modified => write the object completely at once
* no lock mechanism
* flat structure, so better at scaling
* least expensive

SDS (Software Defined Storage)

create a storage pool from cheap hardware.

- Unlike LVM it spans physical hosts.

- Unlike monolithic SAN and NAS systems that tightly couple software and
  hardware, SDS products enable users to upgrade the software separately from
  the hardware.
