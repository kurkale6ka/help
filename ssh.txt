Ordinary Password Authentication
--------------------------------
password required for every connection

--> username
<-- PASSWORD
--> password (/etc/passwd)

Public Key Access
-----------------
passphrase required for every connection

--> username + request to use a public key
<-- KEY CHALLENGE (after looking in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys)
--> key response (after unlocking id_rsa with the passphrase)

Public Key Access with Agent support (local key holder)
-------------------------------------------------------
passphrase required only once and used for all connections

--> username + request to use a public key
<-- KEY CHALLENGE (after looking in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys)

* The ssh client receives the key challenge, and forwards it to the waiting agent
* The agent constructs the key response and hands it back to the ssh process
  (after unlocking id_rsa with the passphrase)

--> key response

Public Key Access with Agent Forwarding
---------------------------------------
passphrase required only once and used for all connections, plus allow sshing
from destinations by forwarding the key challenge to the initial local server

Problem:
Once logged into a remote server, connecting from there to yet a third server
requires either password access, or setting up the user's private key...

server0       server1        server2

ssh --------- sshd
              >
  FORWARDING /   \
             \   / FORWARDING
                <
              ssh ---------- sshd

* From local server0 connect to server1:

server1 $ --> username + request to use a public key on server2
server1 $ <-- KEY CHALLENGE (after looking in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys)
server1 $     ssh  FORWARDS the key challenge to sshd
                            which relays it to server0, which in turn sends a key response
server1 $     sshd FORWARDS the key response  to ssh
server1 $ --> key response

Requirements:
server0
  ~/.ssh/config
  Host server1
     ForwardAgent yes
  OR
  ssh -A server1

server1
  - AllowAgentForwarding in sshd_config

ssh-agent tests/tasks:
echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
ssh-add -l

~/.ssh/config note:
for ProxyCommand to work an appropriate ssh setup is needed
(like Agent Forwarding or private key on the Proxying host)

Annexe:
http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html

Initial requirements:
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
ssh-add [~/.ssh/id_rsa_git]
OR
eval "$(keychain --eval --agents ssh -Q --quiet id_rsa id_rsa_git)"

Chain ssh invocations in case the user + key changes
----------------------------------------------------

ssh -t user1@server1 'ssh user2@server2'

Copy between 2 remote hosts without access between them
-------------------------------------------------------

scp -3 host1:/tmp/file host2:/tmp

TCP local port forwarding:

our LAN policy prevents access to imgur.com but our jumphost(gateway) can connect:

my machine:3000 -> gateway -> imgur.com:3000
ssh -fN -L 3000:imgur.com:3000 gateway # on my machine

my machine:3000 -> gateway:3000
ssh -fN -L 3000:localhost:3000 gateway # on my machine
                    \
                     gateway

TCP remote port forwarding (reverse tunnel):

ex: secure remote desktop (no firewall openings needed on my machine):
the support person connects via vnc://gateway:5900. they might need local port
forwarding on their side

anyone connecting to the gateway on port 5900 will end up on port 5900 on my machine
ssh -fN -R 5900:localhost:5900 gateway # on my machine
                    \
                     my machine

or in ~/.ssh/config:
host gateway
   LocalForward 3000 imgur.com:3000 # use it with: ssh -fN gateway
