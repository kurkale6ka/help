Benefits of encapsulation

   public name

   file1: obj.name = bla
   file2: obj.name = hey
   file3: obj.name = ole
   file4: obj.name = wow

Problem: now we also need to record the name in a db!

Solution:

   private name

   def setName(self, name):
      self.name = name
      record name in db

   file1: obj.setName(bla)
   file2: obj.setName(hey)
   file3: obj.setName(ole)
   file4: obj.setName(wow)

Conclusion:

   By using a private name, we now only have to change the setter instead of
   all the places where we were directly modifying the property!
