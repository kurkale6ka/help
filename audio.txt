Stereophonic sound creates an illusion of directionality and audible
perspective. Stereo uses an array of microphones (for true stereo) to capture
sound (1 channel per micro) and two or more loudspeakers are necessary in order
to recreate it. Simulated stereo is when a mono signal is manipulated by
software to create delays and changes in amplitude.
The reason we use stereo is because we have two ears thus we perceive sounds
with delay and pressure difference in each ear. Mono uses a single audio
channel.
