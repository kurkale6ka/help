                                    =======

You can’t kill a zombie process because it’s already dead. Zombies are
basically dead processes that haven’t been cleaned up. The child notifies his
parent that it has terminated, with the SIGCHLD signal. The parent then is
supposed to call wait() in order to gather info from the dead process. After
wait() is called, the zombie process is completely removed from memory. Zombies
keep a descriptor in memory + they preserve their PIDs. Zombies are harmless
unless there are so many it results in a shortage of PIDs.

Solutions:
* Resend SIGCHLD
* Kill the parent which will make init the new parent and rely on init to call
  wait() which it does periodically
* Reprogram the parent so it doesn't ignore SIGCHLD and calls wait()
