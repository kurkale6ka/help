UNIX domain sockets are an IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism for local processes.

TCP/IP sockets allow communication over the network. You can use TCP/IP sockets
locally via the loopback interface.

UNIX sockets are subject to file system permissions, while TCP sockets can be
controlled only on the packet filter level.

UNIX sockets are local, so they can avoid some checks and operations (like
routing) which makes them faster and lighter than IP sockets.
