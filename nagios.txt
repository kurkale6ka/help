NRPE - Nagios Remote Plugin Executor
====================================

The NRPE addon consists of two pieces:
--------------------------------------
The check_nrpe plugin, which resides on the local monitoring machine
The NRPE daemon, which runs on the remote Linux/Unix machine

1. Nagios will execute the check_nrpe plugin and tell it what service needs to
   be checked
2. The NRPE daemon runs the appropriate Nagios plugin to check the service or
   resource. The NRPE daemon is started by xinetd

Note: The NRPE daemon requires that Nagios plugins package be installed on the
      remote Linux/Unix host. Without these, the daemon wouldn't be able to
      monitor anything.

Test: clush -aB '/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H localhost'
      Use the appropriate plugins location on your remote hosts
