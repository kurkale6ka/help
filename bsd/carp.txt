Common Address Redundancy Protocol
----------------------------------

create a group of redundant firewalls (failover):

Allow multiple hosts on the same network segment to share a virtual/floating
IP. This is not loadbalanced. One host (the master) only is active and
broadcasts it's status to all hosts in the redundancy group. If it fails, a
backup host from the group takes over.

Change master role to backup:
ifconfig -g carp carpdemote 50
