Common Address Redundancy Protocol
----------------------------------

  common address: CARP, VRRP
     @  |  /
      \ | /
 reverse proxy: relayd, nginx
      / | \
     @  @  @
web 1   2   3 servers

similar to VRRP and Cisco's HSRP

create a group of redundant firewalls (failover):

Allow multiple hosts on the same network segment to share a virtual/floating
IP. This is not loadbalanced. One host (the master) only is active and
broadcasts it's status to all hosts in the redundancy group. If it fails, a
backup host from the group takes over.

Change master role to backup:
ifconfig -g carp carpdemote 50
