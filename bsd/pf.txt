Packets are evaluated against all (unless using 'quick') filter rules, the last
one winning. Unmatched packets pass by default.

Simplified filter rule syntax:
pass/block, in/out, [log|quick], on eth0, inet(6), proto tcp, from A port 22, to B port 22, flags, state

NAT
===

match     on ext-nic from 10.0.0.40 to any     binat-to 88.0.0.40 # priv <-> Internet (bidirectional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
match out on ext-nic from 10.0.0.40 to any       nat-to 88.0.0.40 # priv -> Internet (uni)
match  in on ext-nic from any       to 88.0.0.40 rdr-to 10.0.0.40 # Internet -> priv (uni)

match  in on int-nic from int-net   to 88.0.0.40 rdr-to 10.0.0.40 # priv -> priv

Filter
======

# 1. Internet <-> priv IP rules makes sense for filtering since we've defined
#    how to talk to the private IPs in the NAT rules
#
# 2. pass in doesn't mean being contacted from Internet. It just means packets
#    entering the interface, potentially coming from internal sources


# Firewall with several external NICs, gateways to different ISPs
pass in on ext-nic from any to 10.0.0.40 port 443 reply-to (ext-nic gw2) # route back trough gw2

test config:
pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf

show rules:
pfctl -sr

pfctl -Tshow -t{table_name}
