Makefile for Berkeley DB files:

Forwarding:
mynetworks -> anywhere
 strangers -> relay_domains

local_recipients:
for local(8) delivery, all mydestination domains are equal, with one shared namespace.
fname.lname(@domain not needed) ok

virtual_alias_maps:
Tables will be searched in the specified order until a match is found. Yes but:

VIRTUAL(5):
user@domain address, address, ... <- 1st this form is tried against all tables
user address, address, ...        <- then this one
@domain address, address, ...     <- and finally this one

Address rewriting:
          cleanup(8)                                  local(8)
canonical (envelope + headers)    -    queues    -    aliases
  virtual (envelope)

NB: in transport_maps we can overwrite the local transport with something else
    so aliases will not be reached.

virtual aliasing solves one problem:
it allows each domain to have its own info mail address

/etc/postfix/virtual:
info@example.com joe

/etc/postfix/aliases:
info: info

Certificates:
Domain validity in mail world is established using DKIM and SPF vs CA.
So if our DKIM/SPF checks pass, clients will be safe and they will accept our self signed certificate.

smtpd_tls_security_level = may # for incoming emails, encrypt with our cert if client wants it
 smtp_tls_security_level = may # for outgoing emails, encrypt with remote cert if available

smtpd_tls_cert_file = # the .chn is actually expected as there is no smtpd_tls_ca_file

Queues:
mailq # see all queues
postcat -q ID
qshape deferred # queue shape

Commands:
