                     Hypervisors (virtual machine monitors)

native, bare metal hypervisors: (KVM)
hardware -> hypervisor -> guest OSs

hosted hypervisors: (VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU (Quick Emulator), KVM)
hardware -> OS -> hypervisor -> guest OSs

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) is a Linux kernel module that allows a user space
program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors
QEMU uses emulation; KVM uses processor extensions (HVM) for virtualization.

Libvirt

System URIs connect to the system libvirtd daemon (started by system
init scripts), which is shared among all users on the machine, and which
allows access to anything that requires superuser capabilities (such as
creating tun devices for networking).

Session URIs connect to a per-user daemon (which will be started
automatically if needed), and which cannot access anything that the user
cannot access (and unfortunately, given that no one has yet figured out
how to make Linux share tun devices with ordinary users, that means that
session guests are currently rather limited because they will not have
networking support). The goal is to make things support full
virtualization under session URIs, once the kernel adds the support we
need for networking.
