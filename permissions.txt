       \\*- cd + use
        \*-- create stuff (requires x)
         *--- ll

x is needed everywhere!
we must be able to traverse (cd) the whole path

Example:

% namei -l /etc/yum/vars/test
dr-xr-xr-[x] root  root  /
drwxr-xr-[x] root  root  etc/
drwxr-xr-[x] root  root  yum/
drwxr-xr-[x] root  root  vars/
drwxr-xr-[x] mitko mitko test/

here mitko would be able to:
touch /etc/yum/vars/test/bla

because only the final (leaf) permissions count as long as x is everywhere.

NB: no w on any of the intermediary folders is needed by that user!

Special bits

  suid
setuid: allow users to run a program as the owner
        -rwsr-xr-x root root /usr/bin/sudo

setgid: allow users to run a program as the group
        -rwxr-sr-x root crontab /usr/bin/crontab

        directory with setgid:
        new files will inherit the directory's group

sticky bit:
when set on a directory, files inside can only be removed by their owners

 421
 ||+ sticky (t)
 |+ setgid (s if x also set, else S)
 + setuid (s)

ex: chmod 2755 is equivalent to
    chmod g+s
