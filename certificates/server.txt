                           server certificate change

1. hostname -f must match the certificate's subject

* NB: hostname    uses static info (ex: from /etc/sysconfig/network)
      hostname -f uses DNS so you must be able to resolve the IP based on the static value.
                  you will need to change bind/AWS/... zones

* For info I used these change domain for bla from bad_example.com to example.com:
  cli53 rd bad_example.com bla A
  cli53 rc example.com 'bla 600 A 11.10.10.11'

2. rsync your certificate, key and CA and amend in apache:
   SSLCertificateFile
   SSLCertificateKeyFile
   SSLCACertificateFile # not sure this is actually needed

3. test with:
   /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl s_client -connect bla.example.com:443
   depth=3 C = SE, O = AddTrust AB, OU = AddTrust External TTP Network, CN = AddTrust External CA Root
   depth=2 C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = COMODO CA Limited, CN = COMODO RSA Certification Authority
   depth=1 C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = COMODO CA Limited, CN = COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
   depth=0 OU = Domain Control Validated, OU = PositiveSSL Wildcard, CN = *.example.com
   verify return:1

test.chn:
/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.example.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' > /tmp/test.chn

cat .crt .ca.crt > .chn

* ^ certificate chain from end user, trough intermediate certificates to root
    certificate available in the trust store of your device

* NB: On a Mac I've used /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl since
      /usr/bin/openssl isn't aware of the correct location for the root certificates
      and reports them as untrusted

* there might still be a 'not fully secure' message from the browser but that
  could be parts of the site such as images still being served over http. check in firefox

Misc:

# wildcard/star certificate
openssl x509 -in example.com.crt -noout -subject
subject= /OU=Domain Control Validated/OU=PositiveSSL Wildcard/CN=*.example.com

# Issuer
openssl x509 -in example.com.crt -noout -issuer
issuer= /C=GB/ST=Greater Manchester/L=Salford/O=COMODO CA Limited/CN=COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
