DS:variable_name:DST:heartbeat:min:max
--------------------------------------

DS - data source
DST -
   COUNTER will save the rate of change
   DERIVE is the same as COUNTER, but it allows negative values as well
   ABSOLUTE also saves the rate of change, but it assumes that the previous value is set to 0
   GAUGE does not save the rate of change. It saves the actual value itself

heartbeat - time in seconds before saving UNKNOWN

min, max - any data out of range is saved as UNKNOWN

RRA:CF:xff:step:rows
--------------------

Consolidation function (CF) - AVERAGE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, and LAST
   Uses step number of PDPs per row (primary data points: one PDP per --step: see create below)

xff - XFiles Factor (XFF), this is the percentage of PDPs that can be unknown
      without making the recorded value unknown

        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:24     \ ( 12  * 300 = one value per 1h,  24 => a day)
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:31      ( 288 * 300 = one value per 24H, 31 => a month)
