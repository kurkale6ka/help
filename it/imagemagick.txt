Argument                          Action Performed                                Images
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
convert             Initialize and Create an empty 'image list'                   empty seq
eye.gif             Read in image and add to end of current image list            1 image
news.gif            Add a second image into list (now with two images)            2 images
-append             Take all images in current list, and append vertically.
                    All images are replaced by a single image.                    1 (merged)
storm.gif           Add another image to the image list                           2
tree.gif            And another                                                   3
-background skyblue Set a 'background color' to be used later.
                    No changes are made to any images.                            3
+append             Join all 3 images in the list horizontally
                    Current background color is used to fill the empty space      1 (merged)
result.gif          As this is last argument, an explicit -write operation is

                    image the list is written using the given filename and image
                    file format.                                                  written

Command Line:
1. + input filenames.
2. * image settings.  Ex: ‑adjoin, ‑affine, ‑alpha, ‑antialias # an image setting stays in effect until it is reset
3. * image operators. Ex: ‑contrast, ‑convolve, ‑crop, ‑cycle  # an operator is applied to an image and forgotten
4. * image sequence operators.
5. * image stacks.
6. ? output image filenames (required by convert, composite, montage, compare, import, conjure).

Print image dimensions:
identify -format '%w x %h (width x height)' image.jpg
