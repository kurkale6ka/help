The legacy MBR partition scheme allows 4 "primary" partitions at most. To
bypass this limitation, one of the partitions must be "extended" instead of
"primary" so it can contain several "logical" partitions.

Windows is unable to boot from logical partitions.

The newer partition scheme, GPT, doesn't have such a restriction, and does not
need to use extended/logical partitions.
