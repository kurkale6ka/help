# RAID  0 - 2d - Striping
r/w fast but data loss

# RAID  1 - 2d - Mirroring
    R/w fast but ½ storage
rebuild fast but no hot swap (poweroff needed)

# RAID 10 - 4,6,...d - stripe across RAID 1 pairs/legs (0 & 1 combined)
    r/w fast but ½ storage
rebuild fast
hot swap
can withstand 2 fails (depending upon which 2)

# RAID  5 - 3d - Blocks striped across n-1 drives + block parity checksum on the last
r fast but w (+rebuild) slow because of checksum
hot swap

# RAID  6 - 4d - Striping with double parity
r fast but w even slower
withstands 2 fails
