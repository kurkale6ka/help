The 'default' subtree affects all new interfaces. Assigning a value to a
configuration key beneath default will not affect existing interfaces but acts
as a template for new interfaces.
The highest value set in either the interface specific subtree or the 'all'
subtree will be the effective setting.

Here we want 0 on reverse path filtering for p1p1 so 'all' needs to be 0 else
it would overwrite p1p1's value:

% sysctl -w 'net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0' # temp: put in /etc/sysctl.conf for persistence
% sysctl -ar '\.rp_filter'

net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
net.ipv4.conf.p1p1.rp_filter = 0
