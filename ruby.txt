Rack Servers
============

Rack provides a minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks

Phusion Passenger (mod_rails, mod_rack) is a free web server and application
server with support for Ruby, Python and Node.js. It is designed to integrate
into the Apache HTTP Server or the nginx web server. It supports arbitrary Ruby
web frameworks through the Rack interface

Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve fast
clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take advantage of
features in Unix/Unix-like kernels

Bundler
=======

Ensure a bundle of gems get installed at their expected versions.

gem install bundler

Gemfile:
gem "nokogiri", "~> 1.4.4" # I want nokogiri as long as itâ€™s greater than version 1.4.4

bundle install will install the latest stable version of nokogiri in this case.
Using Gemfile.lock, we make sure, say, version 1.5.3 gets installed.

So first, Gemfile.lock gets created after running bundle install, then it gets
used for all subsequent runs of bundle install!

bundle exec executes a script using the gems specified in the script's Gemfile
rather than the systemwide Gemfile
