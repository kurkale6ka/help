Exclude stuff

find [path] [conditions to prune] -prune -o [usual conditions] -print

-name goo -prune without a -print, includes an explicit -print:
only files or directories matching 'goo' are printed, but not descended, thus a
second folder goo under the first one won't be printed

-type d -name goo -prune -o -print:
because of the explicit -o -print: we either exclude (without printing) or
print when we don't exclude
